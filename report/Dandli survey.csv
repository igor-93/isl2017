"2017/05/30 9:08:59 AM GMT+2","Yes","5","It seemed that I had to put in too much effort thinking about accounts to specify as the basis for tag/time recommendations. Also too many of the suggested unfollows were either friends or people who regularly like my images.","3","As indicated above, it would be much simpler to use if I didn't have to specify the accounts to base recommendations on and this could somehow be automated.","Recently posted comments","It is easy to miss comments on older posts, so the most useful feature was to see comments grouped in one place. ","I didn't find the hash recommendations very helpful as since they were based on people I follow, it tended to be that the suggestions were tags that I already use. But I accept that this feature would be useful to someone new to Instagram. For me, it would actually be more useful to suggest tags that I don't use regularly.","Comments' sentiments","As stated above, a different approach to generating tag suggestions would be what I would focus on. Also one might want to take into account the ""experience"" of the user in terms of their current tag usage. The recommendations for people to Unfollow also needs some refinement as I think I only followed the recommendation in a couple of cases. The basic idea of unfollowing people because they don't follow me or they unfollow me after a time is still a godo approach.","From a business perspective, one thing that I found was that it is a tool that I might use initially to get an overview of recommended times to post and hashtags to use, but there's not enough there that would keep me returning on a daily basis so I would be unlikely to pay for the services :-)","Yes","2","No, Not at all","3","Already answered above","","3","No, Not at all","5","The more accounts that I added, the more the recommended times spread due to different time zones of users so in the end it wasn't really that helpful to me.
